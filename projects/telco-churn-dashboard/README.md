# Telco Customer Churn Dashboard
This project is to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company by looking into different churn rates: by contract, by tenure, and by monthly charges, which are often indicators for customers leaving. There is also a KPI card which specifies the High Risk Customer Segment in which customers pay monthly charges of more than 90 euros and whose tenures are less than 12 months.

It can be seen from the dashboard that the high churn rates can be driven by the contract length, tenure, and monthly charges. The trend line chart for monthly charges specifically shows that the line becomes more dense when it goes more to the right, suggesting that the higher the monthly charge is, the more likely customers are to leave.
