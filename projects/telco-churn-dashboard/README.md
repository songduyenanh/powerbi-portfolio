# Telco Customer Churn Dashboard
This project is to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company by looking into different churn rates: by contract, by tenure, and by monthly charges, which are often indicators for customers leaving. There is also a KPI card which specifies the High Risk Customer Segment in which customers pay monthly charges of more than 90 euros and whose tenures are less than 12 months.
