# Network Usage Analysis (January 2020)
This project uses a sample of 20 customers across India in order to analyze their network usage patterns in January 2020, including amounts of data used, calls made, and SMS sent. The data was retrieved from the Internet, then cleaned and transformed. The dashboard includes three cards showing the main metrics (Total Calls, Total Data Used, and Total SMS Sent), a chart describing the daily volume trend, a map about the customers" data usage in different states, and another chart of calls made versus SMS sent.

Additionally, alhough there are many different telecommunications partners trusted across India, Vodafone and BSNL are the two largest ones.
