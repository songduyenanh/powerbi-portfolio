# Call Center Performance Analysis (January 2021)
This project is to analyze a call center's performance in January 2021 based on the performances of its agents. The dashboard includes a chart describing the daily call volume trend, a chart of resolution rate, and another one of average satisfaction rate, both by agent. There are also three KPI cards which show the total calls, the average satisfaction rate, and the average talk duration.

The chart on the left shows the total number of daily calls in January 2021 at a call center. It can be seen that the call center received about 55 calls every day on average, with the maximum number of 84 calls on January 11, 2021. 

Generally, customers were reasonably satisfied with the call center performance, with 3.45 as the average satisfaction rate and approximately 69% as the resolution rate (which is calculated by the division between the number of calls resolved and that of calls received).

The charts on the right demonstrate the resolution rates as well as the average satisfaction rates by agent. The agents' performances are comparable, showing the center's consistent performance.
